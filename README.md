# Critical mess

In this repository you'll find examples of using Double Dispatch and testing methods with 
non-deterministic behaviour.

## Exercises

1. Finish testing and implementing the missing methods for ``FirePokemon`` and 
   ``NormalPokemon``.
2. Create two new types of *Pokémon*, for this choose any 2 types from the ones listed 
   [here](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type/Type_chart#Generation_VI_onward).
   You can choose any type you want but at least one of those should do 0 damage to any other of the implemented types.
3. A *Pokémon* can have multiple attacks of different types.
   Modify the code to support this feature.

All the code of the exercises should be correctly tested
